This program was developed for completion of the OKC Thunder DS&S Technical Assessment as part of consideration
for the Analyst and/or Software Engineer internship position(s) in the Data Science division for the Oklahoma City Thunder. 

## Prerequisites

A Python version of 3.8.10 or later is required. The latest version of choice can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Alternatively, for a Linux environment, an example of how the latest Python version can be downloaded (update as necessary) is shown below:

```install
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3.8
```

## Installation and Usage

To run, the program can be run in the command line. The file to test can be passed in as an argument. An example can be seen below:

```python
python hash.py sample_file.csv
python3 hash.py sample_file.csv
```

Alternatively, the direct file path can be provided, such as if the file is not in the local directory:

```python
python hash.py /path/to/sample_file.csv
python3 hash.py /path/to/sample_file.csv
```

Feel free to modify these steps as necessary to fit your testing preferences
